    <h2>Baseball</h2>
    <p>
        I grew up playing baseball as a hobby. Since a young age, this was how I bonded with my father. He coached me since a young up until I graduated hhighschool. 
        When I played, first base was my primary postion becaus of my height. Every once in a while, I would get thrown into the outfield to snag some fly balls/line drives.
